### Airfoil Tree
An airfoil tree was adjusted to match new convention
**ToDo:**
- [x] Add 'type' column Airfoil tree
    - [ ] control type of LE and TE: free (F), circle (C), elipse(E)
- [x] There is a bug on tree refreshe when ***Type*** is missing

### Reference Tree
A reference widget with buttons was created.
- [x] **Add** button works properly for selig format airfoils
- [x] **Show/Hide** button works properly for selig format airfoils
**ToDo:**
- [ ] To be able to load ddls files as reference
- [ ] To allow to delete reference
- [ ] Secondary:
    - [ ] To allow to modify the reference

### Parameter Table
Updates and populates the tabel properly with the selected airfoil data

    - [ ] Open ← works as a button but **function should be checked after clarification of new airfoil definition**
    - [ ] Save ← works as a button but **function should be checked after clarification of new airfoil definition**
    - [ ] Save As ← works as a button but **function should be checked after clarification of new airfoil definition**
    - [x] Edit Project Description ← **works as intended**
    - [x] Exit ← **works as intended**

# Changelog notes

A new airfoil definition was introduced in the 0.4 version. LE, TE, PS and SS are now separated objects, creating whole airofil.
This led to new Tree Layout where Airfoil is created out of respective objects as parents and childrens.
## Program class

## Project
The structure of Project has been reworked with more conviniently alocated functions such as **New**, **Open**, **Save**, **Save As**, **Edit project description**, **Exit**
Project collects data of:
 - Project Name
 - Project Path
 - Creation Date
 - Modification Date
 - Project Description
 - Created Airfoils
 - Nominal versions of created airfoils - **TO DO: which should refresh on each project launch**
 - Reference Airfoils stored as Selig format .txt or .dat file or **TO DO: handle ddls airfoils**
 - ***Project Components***
 - ***Nominal Components***

## Color schemes
With version 0.4.X color schemes are to be choosen from preferences for viewports and for windows and widgets.
New window modes added:
 - Light - bright mode including white and grey
 - Dark - dark mode including black and dark grey
