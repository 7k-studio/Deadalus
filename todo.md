    - [ ] ~~control type of LE and TE: free (F), circle (C), elipse(E)~~ **postponed to version v4.1**
- [x] Fixed the bug on tree refresh when ***Type*** is missing
- [x] To make the widget store the selected object info data
 
### Reference
A reference can now be handled using both bar menu and specified widget. Both allow to add, delete, show and hide a reference airfoil

**ToDo:**
- [x] **Add** button works properly for selig format airfoils
- [x] **Delete** button works properly for selig format airfoils
- [x] **Show/Hide** button works properly for selig format airfoils
- [ ] To be able to load ddls files as reference
- [ ] Secondary: **postponed to version v4.1**
    - [ ] ~~To allow to modify the reference~~
    - [ ] ~~To allow to flip the reference~~

### Parameter Table
A table was adjusted to new airfoil format. It now updates and populates the tabele properly with the selected airfoil data.
**ToDo:**
- [x] To clear out the rows after airfoil was deleted
- [ ] To repair nominal to stay put untill project open or refresh
 
### Airfoil Description Editing
Description Widget in Airfoil Designer shows the description of an airfoil in the widget or in the dialog. Clicking Edit button allows to edit the text. To edit an airfoil user must first select an airfoil in the airfoil tree. If an airfoil is deleted the default message is being displayed.
**ToDo:**
- [x] To populate the text area with description of selected airfoil
- [x] To save/reject the changes on user's request
- [x] Bullet proof the widget for possible unwanted events
- [x] To clear out after deleding an airfoil

### Statistics Table
New widget added to display statistics of the selected airfoil.
**ToDo:**
- [ ] To investigate the statistics of interest
- [ ] To enlarge the available statistics storage

### Tool Bar
New element added to GUI to quickly navigate the functions of the program. For now the airfoil functions are displayed for quick access it also supports shortcuts:
> Shift+N - add new airfoil
> Shift+A - append selected airfoil
> Shift+X - delete selected airfoil
> Shift+F - flip selected airfoil
> Shift+S - save selected airfoil

**ToDo:**
- [x] To assign functions to each button
- [x] To enlarge the Toolbar with other Essentail Tools

# Changelog notes

A new airfoil definition was introduced in the 0.4 version. LE, TE, PS and SS are now separated objects, creating whole airofil.
This led to new Tree Layout where Airfoil is created out of respective objects as parents and childrens.
## Program class

## Project
The structure of Project has been reworked with more conviniently alocated functions such as **New**, **Open**, **Save**, **Save As**, **Edit project description**, **Exit**
Project collects data of:
 - Project Name
 - Project Path
 - Creation Date
 - Modification Date
 - Project Description
 - Created Airfoils
 - Nominal versions of created airfoils - **TO DO: which should refresh on each project launch**
 - Reference Airfoils stored as Selig format .txt or .dat file or **TO DO: handle ddls airfoils**
 - ***Project Components***
 - ***Nominal Components***

## Color schemes
With version 0.4.X color schemes are to be choosen from preferences for viewports and for windows and widgets.
New window modes added:
 - Light - bright mode including white and grey
